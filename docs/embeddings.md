# 🧬 Embeddings

Embeddings are the A.I-native way to represent any kind of data, making them the perfect fit for working with all kinds of A.I-powered tools and algorithms. They can represent text, images, and soon audio and video. There are many options for creating embeddings, whether locally using an installed library, or by calling an API.

Chroma provides lightweight wrappers around popular embedding providers, making it easy to use them in your apps. You can set an embedding function when you create a Chroma collection, which will be used automatically, or you can call them directly yourself.

To get Chroma's embedding functions, import the `chromadb.utils.embedding_functions` module.

```python
from chromadb.utils import embedding_functions
```

## Default: Sentence Transformers

By default, Chroma uses [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) to create embeddings. Sentence Transformers is a library for creating sentence and document embeddings that can be used for a wide variety of tasks. It is based on the [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) library from Hugging Face. This embedding function runs locally on your machine, and may require you download the model files (this will happen automatically).

```python
sentence_transformer_ef = embedding_functions.SentenceTransformerEmbeddingFunction(model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
```

You can pass in an optional `model_name` argument, which lets you choose which Sentence Transformers model to use. By default, Chroma uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`. You can see a list of all available models [here](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html).

## OpenAI

Chroma provides a convenient wrapper around OpenAI's embedding API. This embedding function runs remotely on OpenAI's servers, and requires an API key. You can get an API key by signing up for an account at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/).

This embedding function relies on the `opeanai` python package, which you can install with `pip install openai`.

```python
openai_ef = embedding_functions.OpenAIEmbeddingFunction(
                api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
                model_name="text-embedding-ada-002"
            )
```

You can pass in an optional `model_name` argument, which lets you choose which OpenAI embeddings model to use. By default, Chroma uses `text-embedding-ada-002`. You can see a list of all available models [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings).

## Custom Embedding Functions

You can create your own embedding function to use with Chroma, it just needs to implement the `EmbeddingFunction` protocol.

```python
from chromadb.api.types import Documents, EmbeddingFunction, Embeddings

class MyEmbeddingFunction(EmbeddingFunction):
    def __call__(self, texts: Documents) -> Embeddings:
        # embed the documents somehow
        return embeddings
```

We welcome contributions! If you create an embedding function that you think would be useful to others, please consider [submitting a pull request](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma) to add it to Chroma's `embedding_functions` module.
